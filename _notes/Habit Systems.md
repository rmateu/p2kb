# Habit Systems

Mostly a combination of [Everyday Systems] principles and the [Atomic Habits] book.

## Currently in use

- **HIIT Man**: Define myself as a High-Intensity Interval Training so I practice it more. 
- **Zero Coke Zero**: No Coke's or Dr. Peppers during the weekdays. 
- **Walkabout**: Whenever I get stuck on something *walk it off™*.
- **Mind the joy**: Be aware and in control of the hundreds of joyful moments through out the day. 
- **Writing session**: Set time and either write or just sit there. 
- **Inward Thinking**: When there's something nagging me, give me time to explore it.
- **Compound reading**: Remember to read stuff that adds something, whoever small. 
- **An Errand a Day**: Tackle the  personal tasks lists. 
- **Pleasure reading**: Read what makes me happy. 
- **[No S Diet][nosd]**: No snacks, sweets, seconds, except (sometimes) on days that start with "S".
- **Weekend Luddite**: Avoid my devices on weekends (Breakfast to Dinner)
- **localhost pillow** : Once the head hits the pillow, no browsing the internet. 
- **DoerEats**: Cook something. 
- **Motion & Action**: Don't get stuck in planning, execute something. 
- **Bipedal mobility**: I can get there walking.
