# Health

Initially called this main category *productivity*, but that should actually be a *by-product* of a working healthy lifestyle. 

Also feel there needs to be sub categories for healthy body, and healthy mind. Depending of the length and level of detail of content – each can become a category of its own. If I ever manage to start swimming consistently again for example. 

For now, health is loosely defined as:

> He took care of his body for the purpose of health—not vanity—and he rarely needed a doctor’s service  
> 
~ Marcus Aurelius, The Meditations
