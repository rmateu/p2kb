# Obsidian Setup

Obsidian has become the center on my note-taking and note-keeping. 

## Naming Conventions

- **Meetings and time sensitive notes**
These are prefixed with `YYMMDD` and some short description, i.e. *210209 Debug CO Items* or *210117 Call Broken Inventory*. Sadly for me, both of these short descriptions will happen bore than once, so the time stamp helps a lot with the context. 

- **Index or Main Pages**
Homepages for projects, areas, etc are prefixed with `ix`, with to make them easy to find and visually identifiable. Some examples: *ix Ecom Catalog* and *ix Taxes US 2020*

- **~~Daily~~ Weekly Note**
I use the daily note plugin a lot – giving it the cntrl+e shortcut to have quick access at any time. *However*, I change the date format to `YYYY[w]WW`, which results in files titles like *2021w06*. This feels less restrictive and workable than actual daily notes. And lets me *see* the week better, moving stuff along the days. 

In a way the Weekly Note becomes the index for the week activities. Allowing me to easily link tasks to their corresponding page, or create empty links, which once clicked will become the starting point for the task.

- **Vaults**
Two main *Vaults* (Obsidian-speak for libraries) are my starting points: KBwork and KBme. Both are being synced via iCloud – but it would actually work better if I still subscribed to Dropbox. 

I'm currently experimenting with two additional ones: *5typos* and *tico*. The first is on Dropbox[^maestral], and the second is on a Github repo – the source for this site.
